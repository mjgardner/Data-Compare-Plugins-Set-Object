=head1 NAME

Data::Compare::Plugins::Set::Object - plugin for Data::Compare to handle Set::Object objects

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Data::Compare::Plugins::Set::Object version 1.0_5

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Set::Object 'set';
    use Data::Compare;

    my $foo = {
        list => [ qw(one two three) ],
        set  => set( [1], [2], [3] ),
    };
    my $bar = {
        list => [ qw(one two three) ],
        set  => set( [1], [2], [3] ),
    };

    say 'Sets in $foo and $bar are ',
        $foo->{set} == $bar->{set} ? '' : 'NOT ', 'identical.';
    say 'Data within $foo and $bar are ',
        Compare($foo, $bar) ? '' : 'NOT ', 'equal.';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Enables L<Data::Compare> to Do The Right Thing for L<Set::Object> objects.
Set::Object already has an C<equals()> method, but it only returns true if
objects within two sets are exactly equal (i.e. have the same references,
referring to the same object instance).  When using Data::Compare in
conjuction with this plugin, objects in sets are considered the same if their
B<contents> are the same.  This extends down to sets that contain arrays,
hashes, or other objects supported by Data::Compare plugins.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

As a plugin to Data::Compare, the interface is the same as Data::Compare
itself: pass the reference to two data structures to the C<Compare> function,
which for historical reasons is exported by default.

Set::Object also can export certain functions, and overloads comparison
operators pertaining to sets.  Consult the
L<Set::Object documentation|Set::Object> for more information.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

See the L<documentation for Data::Compare|Data::Compare>.
