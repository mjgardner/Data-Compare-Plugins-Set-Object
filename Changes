Revision history for Data-Compare-Plugins-Set-Object

1.0    Sun Nov  1 21:10:00 2009
       First non-developer release.
1.0_5  Wed Sep 30 18:55:00 2009
       Minor fix to dependencies listing.
1.0_4  Wed Sep 30 18:05:00 2009
       Reduce second set by each found element, so there's no need to loop
       over it again.  This also removes the need for a separate counter
       variable.
       Use List::Util's first() for above instead of List::MoreUtils' any().
       Minor Perl::Critic-instigated fixes, and more code commentary.
