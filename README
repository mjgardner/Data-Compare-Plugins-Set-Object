Data-Compare-Plugins-Set-Object version 1.0_6

This module is a plugin for Data::Compare, enabling it to compare the data
within Set::Object objects.  It uses Data::Compare to recursively descend
references to data structures within sets, rather than merely comparing the
references themselves to see if they refer to the same object/structure.
